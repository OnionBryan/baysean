    "\n",
    "This tutorial provides a comprehensive framework for conducting Bayesian moderated mediation analysis (first-stage moderation; Hayes Model 8) using the brms package in R. We demonstrate estimation of the Index of Moderated Mediation (IMM = $a_3 \\times b$) through multivariate Bayesian regression with weakly informative priors. Monte Carlo simulation (500 replications per cell) evaluates estimator performance across sample sizes (N = 100-1000), effect magnitudes (IMM = 0-0.16), and missing data conditions (0-20% MCAR). Results confirm unbiased estimation (|bias| < 0.01), nominal coverage of 95% credible intervals (94-96%), and adequate power (≥80%) for medium effects (IMM = 0.10) at N ≥ 250. Four empirical demonstrations spanning social psychology, labor economics, communication, and clinical domains illustrate both successful detection (Garcia: IMM = 0.27 [0.07, 0.49]; SLID: IMM = 0.20 [0.12, 0.28]) and appropriate null findings (Tal-Or, FacialBurns). Direct comparison with frequentist bootstrapping shows convergent validity for adequately powered studies, with Bayesian advantages emerging for small samples (N < 100), mixed outcome families, and posterior probability inference. Complete annotated R code, diagnostic procedures, and reporting templates are provided.\n",

    "### Plain Language Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes the effect of one variable on another works through a middle step (mediation), and this middle step may be stronger or weaker depending on a third variable (moderation). Testing this \"moderated mediation\" is common in psychology but typically uses methods that don't work well with small samples or complex data.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial teaches you a Bayesian approach---a statistical method that directly tells you \"there's a 95% chance the effect is between X and Y\"---which is what most researchers actually want to know. We show you exactly how to do this in R using the brms package, with step-by-step code you can adapt.\n",
    "\n",
    "We tested the method with computer simulations and found it works well: you need about 250 participants to reliably detect a medium-sized effect. We also applied it to four real datasets from different research areas. Two showed significant moderated mediation; two didn't---and we explain why this happened.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tutorial includes templates for writing up your results, common mistakes to avoid, and guidance on when to use Bayesian versus traditional methods. All code is available online so you can apply these techniques to your own data."

    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide provides a comprehensive walkthrough for conducting Bayesian moderated mediation analysis using the `brms` package in R. Moderated mediation---also called conditional indirect effects or conditional process analysis---represents one of the most important analytical frameworks in contemporary psychological and organizational research (Hayes, 2018; Preacher et al., 2007). While frequentist methods for moderated mediation are well-established (Hayes, 2013; Preacher & Hayes, 2008), Bayesian approaches offer several distinct advantages that have been underutilized in applied research.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Literature Review: Bayesian Approaches to Mediation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Historical Development\n",
    "\n",
    "The foundation of Bayesian mediation analysis was laid by Yuan and MacKinnon (2009), who demonstrated that Bayesian methods could recover indirect effects with greater precision than bootstrapping, particularly with small samples and non-normal data. Their work established that the posterior distribution of the indirect effect ($ab$) naturally captures the non-symmetric, potentially non-normal shape that characterizes products of coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "Subsequent developments by Muthén and Asparouhov (2012, 2015) extended Bayesian mediation to structural equation modeling frameworks, introducing techniques for handling complex latent variable models with Bayesian estimation. They demonstrated particular advantages for models with small sample sizes where maximum likelihood estimation performs poorly. Wang and Preacher (2015) provided the first comprehensive treatment of Bayesian moderated mediation specifically, establishing the methodological foundation for the approach presented in this tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages of Bayesian Moderated Mediation\n",
    "\n",
    "Several key advantages motivate the Bayesian approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Proper uncertainty quantification**: The Index of Moderated Mediation (IMM = $a_3 \\times b$) is a product of parameters with inherently non-normal sampling distribution. Bayesian methods directly compute the posterior distribution without asymptotic assumptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Prior information integration**: Researchers can incorporate previous findings through informative priors, particularly valuable in replication studies or when testing theoretically constrained hypotheses.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Interpretable inference**: The 95% credible interval directly states \"there is a 95% probability the parameter lies within this range\"---a more intuitive interpretation than frequentist confidence intervals.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Small sample performance**: Regularizing priors improve estimation stability when sample sizes are limited, a common challenge in organizational and clinical research (McNeish, 2016; Smid et al., 2020). Miočević et al. (2017) demonstrated that Bayesian methods for mediation effect sizes show superior properties compared to frequentist alternatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Model flexibility**: The `brms` package enables multivariate models with mixed response types (continuous mediators, binary outcomes), multilevel structures, and complex non-linear relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Current State of the Literature\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite these advantages, Bayesian moderated mediation remains underrepresented in psychological methods literature. A review of recent publications reveals:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Most tutorials focus on simple mediation (e.g., Nuijten et al., 2015)\n",
    "- Moderated mediation guidance typically uses frequentist frameworks (e.g., Hayes & Rockwood, 2017)\n",
    "- Few resources bridge the gap between Bayesian theory and practical implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide addresses that gap by providing step-by-step implementation with `brms`, empirical demonstrations across multiple domains, and direct comparison with frequentist alternatives.\n",

    "## When to Use This Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Moderated mediation (also called conditional indirect effects) is appropriate when:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You hypothesize that X affects Y through mediator M\n",
    "2. The strength of this indirect effect depends on a moderator W\n",
    "3. You want full posterior distributions rather than point estimates\n",
    "\n",
    "## Running Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this guide, we use:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **X**: Broker Network Richness (BNR) - diversity of professional contacts\n",
    "- **M**: Time to Meeting (TTM) - weeks until first investor meeting\n",
    "- **Y**: Funding Success (FS) - binary outcome (0/1)\n",
    "- **W**: Founder Preparedness (FP) - moderator variable"

    "\n",
    "1. **Properly propagates uncertainty** from M to Y equation\n",

    "- `bf()`: Defines a single equation (formula)\n",
    "- `+`: Combines equations into multivariate model\n",
    "- `family`: Specifies distribution (gaussian, bernoulli, etc.)\n",
    "- `set_rescor(FALSE)`: Disables residual correlation estimation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why `set_rescor(FALSE)`?** When your mediator is continuous (Gaussian) but your outcome is binary (Bernoulli), the residual correlation is not mathematically well-defined. A Gaussian model has a continuous residual ($\\epsilon \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2)$), but a Bernoulli model has no residual variance parameter---the variance is fully determined by the mean ($\\text{Var}(Y) = p(1-p)$). Setting `rescor = FALSE` tells `brms` to skip this undefined parameter.\n",
